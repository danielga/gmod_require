# gmod\_require

Modules for Garry's Mod for obtaining pointers to functions inside of modules (specially useful for loading Lua only modules).

## Compiling

The only supported compilation platform for this project on Windows is **Visual Studio 2017**. However, it's possible it'll work with *Visual Studio 2015* and *Visual Studio 2019* because of the unified runtime.

On Linux, everything should work fine as is.

For macOS, any **Xcode (using the GCC compiler)** version *MIGHT* work as long as the **Mac OSX 10.7 SDK** is used.

If stuff starts erroring or fails to work, be sure to check the correct line endings (\n and such) are present in the files for each OS.

## Requirements

This project requires [garrysmod_common][1], a framework to facilitate the creation of compilations files (Visual Studio, make, XCode, etc). Simply set the environment variable '**GARRYSMOD\_COMMON**' or the premake option '**gmcommon**' to the path of your local copy of [garrysmod_common][1].
